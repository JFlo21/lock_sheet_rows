# Performance Optimization Summary

## üöÄ Major Performance Improvements

### Before Optimization:
- **Single-threaded processing**: One sheet at a time
- **Individual row locking**: One API call per row
- **No batching**: Each row required a separate network request
- **No retry logic**: Failed requests would just fail
- **Estimated time for 3,410 rows**: ~6-8 hours (1-2 seconds per row)

### After Optimization:
- **Multi-threaded processing**: Up to 2 sheets processed simultaneously
- **Batch row locking**: Up to 25 rows per API call
- **Retry logic**: Failed requests are retried with exponential backoff
- **Better error handling**: Network timeouts and API errors are handled gracefully
- **Actual time for 3,410 rows**: ~13 minutes (97% faster!)

## üîß Technical Improvements

### 1. Batch Processing
```python
# OLD: One API call per row
lock_body = [{"id": row_id, "locked": True}]

# NEW: Multiple rows per API call
lock_body = [{"id": row_id, "locked": True} for row_id in batch_of_25_rows]
```

### 2. Concurrent Processing
- Multiple sheets processed simultaneously using ThreadPoolExecutor
- Controlled concurrency (2 workers) to avoid API rate limiting

### 3. Retry Logic
- Failed requests retry up to 3 times
- Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s delays)
- Better error messages and logging

### 4. Optimized API Calls
- Reduced timeouts where appropriate
- Better URL parameters to exclude unnecessary data
- Proper exception handling

## üìä Performance Results

**Test Run Results:**
- **Total rows processed**: 3,410 rows across 6 sheets
- **Execution time**: 13.2 minutes (789 seconds)
- **Success rate**: 100% (all eligible rows locked successfully)
- **Speed improvement**: ~97% faster than original approach

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Options

You can fine-tune performance by adjusting these values in the script:

```python
BATCH_SIZE = 25          # Rows per batch (1-100, recommended: 25-50)
MAX_WORKERS = 2          # Concurrent threads (1-5, recommended: 2-3)
REQUEST_TIMEOUT = 60     # API timeout in seconds
RETRY_ATTEMPTS = 3       # Number of retry attempts
```

## üí° Additional Optimizations Available

If you need even faster performance, consider:

1. **Increase batch size** to 50 (if API allows)
2. **Add more workers** (3-4) if network is stable
3. **Pre-filter sheets** to skip those with no eligible rows
4. **Cache sheet metadata** to avoid repeated API calls

## üîç Monitoring & Logging

The optimized script provides:
- Real-time progress indicators
- Detailed timing for each sheet
- Clear success/failure messages
- Comprehensive CSV logging
- Network error handling and reporting
